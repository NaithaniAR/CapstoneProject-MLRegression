#NYC Taxi Trip Time Prediction - Capstone Project

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), created in 1971, is the agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's Medallion (Yellow) taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles (community-based liveries, black cars and luxury limousines), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. Over 200,000 TLC licensees complete approximately 1,000,000 trips each day.
